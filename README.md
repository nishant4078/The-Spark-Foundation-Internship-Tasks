# The-Spark-Foundation-Internship-Tasks

Internship-Tasks This is one of the tasks given to us in the internship we are doing with The Sparks Foundation i.e GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program ).

# Task 2 :-

Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● Use R or Python or perform this task.

● Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Task 6 :-

Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)

● For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the rightclass accordingly.
